# NeoW Browser
Near Earth Object Web Service interface, for searching NEO's available in NASA's [open-source API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

This UI makes use of the NEO - Feed: 

### Example Query - NEO Feed
> https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed?start_date=2015-09-07&end_date=2015-09-08&api_key=DEMO_KEY
## API Credit
Thanks to the hard work from [The SpaceRocks Team](https://github.com/SpaceRocks/) at NASA, we have access to an abundance of data on Objects coming close to earth.

## Current Limitations
* API only allots a 7 day range for searching for NEO's

## Improvements
* Should make use of the 'browse' feature of the API: https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/browse?api_key=DEMO_KEY
